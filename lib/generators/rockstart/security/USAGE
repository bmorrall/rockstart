Description:
    Adds security checks and middleware to a Rails app

Example:
    rails generate rockstart:security

    This will create:
        Installs bundler-audit to safely check gems
        Installs brakeman to check for any potential exploits
        Adds rack_attack with a simple policy to block most attacks
        Ensures test (and unconfigured) environments are using an in-memory cache
